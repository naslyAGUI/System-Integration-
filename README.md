# System-Integration
System-Integration is a senior mandatory course, which consist of a group project (max:5 students per group). Each group would take a main role to work on the project, my main role was as the Front-end developer. Our project was about a Meal Application that would create a meal plan based on the user's BMI which is given by the user through a questionaire. The meal plan was also modified based on questionaires given to the user. My job was to design and build the website, mostly focusing on the UX. 

API: Spoonacular
Deliverables:
User can set up profile with calculated BMI, Calorie diet
Meal planning recommendations
Allow people to enter meals they have already eaten and get list of suggestions to fill in the rest of the day
